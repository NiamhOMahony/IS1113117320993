        <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals,
        companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis. The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster
        of computers, available all the time, through the Internet. AWS's version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer
        including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and
        pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM, etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O 
        (keyboard, display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window 
        into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer.
        They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for their own and their customers' benefit.</p>
