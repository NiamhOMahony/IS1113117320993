                <p><strong>Job Title:</strong> Coach</p>
                <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2012-Present</p>
                <p><strong>Experience:</strong> I've been with Douglas Gymnastics Club since I was 8 years old. Initially as a participant achieving national 
                gold and bronze medals. I started assisting the older coaches when I was 12 and have been a coach on staff since 2015. With an assistant, 
                I run and organize my own groups of up to 12 children. Key skills for this job included planning sessions ahead of time so children would 
                rotate from each apparatus improving on skills and disciplines and ultimately progressing.</p>

                <p><strong>Experience</strong> I was responsible for teaching groups of up to 30 children as part of a team how to sail. Key skills included
                safety on the water keeping the kids interested in the task at hand and keeping them active. Planning our daily activities and good 
                communication were also key to a successful day on and off the water.</p>
